    <h1>Cristiano Ronaldo</h1>

    <p>Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro; born 5 February 1985) is a Portuguese professional footballer who
        plays as a forward for and captains both Saudi Professional. League club Al Nassr and the Portugal national
        team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo has won five Ballon d'Or awards[note
        3] and four European Golden Shoes, the most by a European player. He has won 34 trophies in his career,
        including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, the UEFA
        European Championship and the UEFA Nations League. Ronaldo holds the records for most appearances (183), goals
        (140), and assists (42) in the Champions League, goals in the European Championship (14), international goals
        (118), and joint-most international appearances (196). He is one of the few players to have made over 1,100
        professional career appearances, and has scored over 820 official senior career goals for club and country.</p>

    <h2>Club Career</h2>

    <h3>Sporting CP</h3>

    <p>At age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's youth team by first-team manager László Bölöni, who was impressed
        with his dribbling.He subsequently became the first player to play for the club's under-16, under-17 and
        under-18 teams, the B team and the first team, all within a single season. A year later, on 29 September
        2002, Ronaldo made his debut in the Primeira Liga, against Braga and on 7 October, he scored two goals against
        Moreirense in their 3–0 win. Over the course of the 2002–03 season, his representatives suggested the player
        to Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier and Barcelona president Joan Laporta. Manager Arsène Wenger, who was
        interested in signing Ronaldo, met with him at Arsenal's stadium in November to discuss a possible transfer.

    <h3>Manchester United</h3>
    <p><b>2003–2007: Development and breakthrough</b></p>
    <p>Ronaldo's move to Manchester United was completed on 12 August 2003, too late for the 2003 FA Community Shield
        but in time for their game against Bolton Wanderers on the opening day of the 2003–04 season, and made him the
        first Portuguese player to sign for the club. His transfer fee made him, at the time, the most expensive
        teenager in English football history. Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received
        the squad number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona and
        David Beckham. Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo. A key element in his
        development during his time in England proved to be Ferguson, of whom he later said: "He's been my father in
        sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my career."</p>

    <h3>Real Madrid</h3>

    <p>Ahead of the 2009–10 season, Ronaldo joined Real Madrid for a world record transfer fee at the time of £80
        million (€94 million). His contract, which ran until 2015, was worth €11 million per year and contained a €1
        billion buy-out clause. At least 80,000 fans attended his presentation at the Santiago Bernabéu, surpassing the
        25-year record of 75,000 fans who had welcomed Diego Maradona at Napoli. Since club captain Raúl already wore
        the number 7 (the number Ronaldo wore at United), Ronaldo received the number 9 shirt, which was presented to
        him by former Madrid player Alfredo Di Stéfano.</p>

        Décima.</p>

    <h3>Juventus</h3>
    <p>Despite months of negotiation to sign a new Real Madrid contract, on 10 July 2018, Ronaldo signed a four-year
        contract with Italian club Juventus after completing a €100 million transfer, which included an additional €12
        million in other fees and solidarity contributions to Ronaldo's youth clubs. The transfer was the highest ever
        for a player over 30 years old, and the highest paid by an Italian club. Upon signing, Ronaldo cited his need
        for a new challenge as his rationale for departing Madrid, but later attributed the transfer to the lack of
        support he felt was shown by club president Florentino Pérez.</p>

    <h3>Return to Manchester United</h3>
    <p><b>2021–2022: 100 Premier League goals and team struggles</b></p>
    <p>On 27 August 2021, Manchester United announced they had reached an agreement with Juventus to re-sign Ronaldo,
        subject to agreement of personal terms, visa and medical. The transfer was for an initial £12.85 million, with a
        two-year contract plus an optional year, and was confirmed on 31 August. Ronaldo was given the number 7 shirt
        after Edinson Cavani agreed to switch to 21. The first 24 hours of Ronaldo's shirt sales was reported to have
        broken the all-time record following a transfer, overtaking Messi after his move to Paris Saint-Germain.</p>

    <h3>Al Nassr</h3>
    <p>On 30 December 2022, Saudi club Al Nassr reached an agreement for Ronaldo to join the club effective 1 January
        2023, signing a contract until 2025. As reported by Fabrizio Romano of The Guardian, Ronaldo received the
        highest football salary in history, worth €200 million per year;[326][327] this included an annual guaranteed
        football salary of €90 million, with commercial and sponsorship deals included bringing his total annual salary
        to €200 million. He was also reportedly paid a signing-on bonus in the region of €100 million. According to
        Romano, Ronaldo rejected a move to Major League Soccer club Sporting Kansas City to join Al Nassr. Ronaldo was
        due to appear in a match against Al-Tai on 5 January 2023, but had to serve a two-match ban incurred while he
        was still at Manchester United for knocking a phone out of a 14-year-old Everton fan's hand after a 1–0 loss at
        Goodison Park in April 2022.</p>
